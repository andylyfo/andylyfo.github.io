## RECIPE

#### Ingredients:
- 80/20 Beef mince. Sometimes sold as 20% fat beef mince. Rolled into \~50g balls and placed on individual squares of parchment. As many as you desire.
- Burger buns. I recommend the St Pierre brioche buns.
- American Cheese
- Vegetable oil
- Condiments and toppings of your choice. Some suggestions later.

#### Equipment and Set-Up:

Smash burgers cook in literally seconds, so the key thing here is prep and being organised. Figures 2 and 3 show the set-up. I'll add in now the order of operations.

1. Stainless Steel or Cast Iron Pan. Crucially this is not coated with Teflon and can take a really high heat. Non-non-stick as it were. I actually switched to my big paella pan when doing the doubles. Pick something with low sides, so your spatula can actually attack the patties when it comes to it. You can set up all the following cold and then started warming everything up.  Or, as this pan is warming, build the surrounding artillery to really shave the minutes off.
2. Second pan. Plot twist. This one is for toasting and warming the buns. It doesn't really matter what kind of pan as long as it warms bread.
3. Here's those aforementioned buns already plated and sauced with ...
4. ... the rest of the toppings. Notice that they're all ready to go.
5. This is the patty. In pre-smashing, unseasoned, spherical form. Use 80/20 beef mince for the best ratio of meat to fat. Each patty is about 50g, anything north of 70g and it gets a bit unwieldy. I would really recommend weighing. Place ready to go on a square of parchment for easy lifting and subsequent smashing. The parchment is crucial so that the smashing doesn't result in meat sticking to the spatula.
6. A Spray Bottle of Water. So this is a good way of testing whether the pan is hot enough. Spray the hot pan. What you're looking for is the droplets to race around the pan like little ball bearings - this is the Leidenfrost effect in action! The pan is hot enough. You're ready to go once the water boils away. I've also been known to use a dip-sized deli container filled with water to flick on the pan with my fingers, in lieu of the spray bottle. 
7. Oil. Use a neutral oil with a high smoke point. Basically not olive oil. I have my oil decanted into this condiment bottle to bump up the ergonomics.
8. Spatula and Rolling Pin. This double-act is for the titular smash.
9. Salt and Pepper.
10. Cheese, if you like cheese. Again, they're ready to go. I hate faffing with the plastic at the best of times, I hate faffing even more when there's a risk of going full [Talking Heads](https://youtu.be/3Z2LhwMprLQ?si=s970zimYr-t1HiI5)

#### METHOD:

If you have all the above set-up, you can start cooking.

1. Warm the burger buns in the dry non-stick pan. Move to the side and dress with sauce.
2. Test the heat of the stainless-steel/cast-iron pan by splashing some water. Once the pan is warm enough that the water beads up and skates around the pan, you're ready to go.[^1]
3. Add a small drizzle of oil to the hot pan.
4. In a smooth motion, place one of the balled patties upside-down on the pan such that the parchment sits on the top.
5. Take your spatula and smash the patty into a thin round, using the butt of a rolling-pin[^2]. In my head, 0.5 cm seems to thin, 1 cm seems to thick, and 0.75 cm is far too finicky. So aim for somewhere in that ballpark. If you're confident, smear the sides to get a beautiful crust.
6. Peel the parchment off and liberally season with salt and pepper.
7. Flip the burger using the spatula. It’s not easy to say exactly when you should flip here in text-based media, but it’s a skill easily worked out. Take note of the sights, smells, and sounds of the first few burgers you flip. I'd say around 30 seconds to a minute. You're looking for a deep brown crust and a patty that releases easily from the pan.
8. Add the cheese. Don't let elitists tell you the American stuff isn't OK, it's categorically the best cheese for burgers, even if it is probably 80% a mixture of plastic and fake tan. Add the un-pictured and un-numbered pan lid[^3] to steam and melt the cheese. Another 60 seconds and you're basically done.
9. Lift the burger from the pan onto your pre-dressed burger buns. Add the rest of the toppings and build your desired burger.

A few suggestions on toppings:

- “Classic” Cheeseburger — Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato[^4], Sliced Onions, Pickles, Ketchup, Mustard.
- “Classic” Cheeseburger with bacon — I’m not rewriting all that. Add bacon, dummy.

Today I went with toppings of American mustard, crunchy fried onions, Calabrian chilli mayo, and gherkins. It was nice. I think I ended up having 6.

I did say that this blog will be food-_related_. That gives me a chance to really get some thoughts out and save them from rattling around my brain for the rest of the week. So the second topic I want to chat briefly about is the value of procedure in home-cooking. Compared to most recipes I cook, the ratio of equipment prep to food-prep/cooking in this one is heavily stacked to the former.

We all have a Platonic ideal in our heads about how the home cook looks and is supposed to act. One-handed cooking, lazily cupping a glass of red that always seems on the edge of spilling. A tea towel tossed over one shoulder. Not afraid of a little colour on the meat, a little smoke and steam. Not beholden to timers and measurements beyond intuition and 'vibes'. Hours across mornings and afternoons indulgently spent gliding across the kitchen and producing something extraordinary for guests at the other side. Maybe donning an apron, maybe not. Sitting in the paradox of low-effort and high-art. To borrow two words from our culinarily inclined neighbours across the channel; _Laissez Faire_. Or to borrow two more; Stanley Tucci.

But the intentional and smooth movements on each pan and dial betray years of experience and the learnings of past mistakes. This recipe for smash burgers is a far cry from the lazy Sunday you'll see from Nigella, but I do think cracking it (or something similar) will get you closer to her prowess when you choose to cook something more “long-form”. It will teach you to be a better cook.

This is high octane cooking and to be quite honest one of the more stressful things I've made at home. Heat is high. Movements and steps come thick and fast. I've counted both your left and right hands touch at least 15 different objects in the space of about 3 minutes, each with a very specific task. Every step is essential and requires focus. Things can go (and have gone!) very wrong.

I mention speed and you may think that means rushing around, but it's really the wrong way to look at it. It's smooth and seamless intentionality. You don't throw things at the pan with pace. Each action has to be measured and exact, rushing is the exact antithesis. A very wise chef once told me “slow is smooth, but smooth is fast”.

What I love about this recipe is how straightforward it all is once your ducks are in a row and that routine is drilled by the third patty. Muscle memory kicks in. Thoughts are sifted like grains of sand out of your mind, and it almost becomes like the meditation of a workout. You ride the crest of a blissful flow. Getting comfortable in the kitchen is essential to becoming a good cook at home.

## DIGESTIFS

*Onto the DIGESTIFS. Not content with focussing on a single topic per post, I've added this section to dump thoughts I've had throughout the week. These might be but won't be limited to: Item of the Week; Good Reads; Quick Reviews; and general tidbits because I don't have Twitter...*

### ITEM OF THE WEEK: Calabrian Chilli Paste

// pic of chilli paste

Here’s a new segment about showcasing my favourite little ingredients or kitchen tools. Usually under a tenner, stuff you can put on your birthday/Christmas list, the things I want to showcase can help you take your home cooking up a notch.

Our inaugural item of the week is Calabrian Chilli Paste. It’s a relatively simple ingredient list of chilli, vinegar, salt, and time to ferment a little. The result is spicy, funky, unctuous demi-condiment with surprising and wide-ranging applications…

You could do as I’ve done above in adding some to a mayo for a great chip-dip and/or burger sauce. Another way to use this is to substitute this in whenever you’re following a recipe that asks for chilli flakes. It's adding that same heat with an extra roundness in flavour from the slight fermentation. For example, it adds a fantastic little extra dimension to a basic aglio e olio. Likewise, add into hot sauce to give it a similar feel to the boujie Lacto-fermented varieties you can find at the farmers market. Just spitballing here, but a classic Frank's Red Hot buffalo wing sauce with a bit of CCP in? Oh mama.

### TIDBIT: French Haribos

A small highlight of trips abroad is the esoteric foods you find in the supermarket, not the big stuff they put on postcards but the weird micro products that the locals seem to like. Haribos, for me, are some of the more intriguing items to look for. As far as Haribo innovation goes, the UK seems to be in the Stone Age.

I spent 6 months working in the French Alps last year and came across this "All Eggs" variety. I'm not quite sure how I feel about it still - a little unnerved, honestly.

#### FOOTNOTES

[^1]: Don’t make the same mistake I did on my first go of adding the oil whilst the water is still whizzing round the pan. Water + Oil + high heat = Angry Pan and pea-sized welts where a spray of hot liquid has been spat all over your hands.
[^2]: If you want to show off, use a bottle of wine in place of a rolling pin. Smoke a dart too.
[^3]: Fuck!
[^4]: I’m not super fussed about tomatoes in burgers. They’re a bit of a nightmare architecturally, slipping the floors above all over the shot.
